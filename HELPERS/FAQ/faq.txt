                Casino is a decentralized crypto gambling platform that blends
                DeFi mechanics with high-stakes entertainment. Players can
                wager, earn rewards through liquidity pools, and even spend
                their winnings using a crypto-powered metal card—no banks
                involved, no middlemen.

              <p >
                Security isn’t a gamble here. All gaming and DeFi protocols run
                on audited smart contracts, with funds locked in non-custodial
                pools. You keep the keys to your wallet, and the platform keeps
                centralized risk out of the picture.

                wallet. Get yours through the dashboard after KYC and a minimum
                staking amount—then hit the streets like a high roller.
